# BetterBetterChatGesturesV3
A fork of [BetterChatGestures](https://github.com/MYSTRAVIL/vendetta-plugins), supposed to work for Discord 295+.

2 types of behaviours :

# Option 1 : Fast taps (desired behaviour)

For it to work, you have to enable the "Double Tap to React" experiment by going to Settings > Experiments > "Double Tap to react" > Enable "Treatment 1: Enabled - Show Half Sheet Upsell" 

# Option 2 : Slow taps (alternative behaviour)

If you don't want the first option, then change the tap delay to 1000s so that you can *tap - delay - tap*
